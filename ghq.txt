== NAME

ghq - Manage remote repository clones

== DESCRIPTION

'ghq' provides a way to organize remote repository clones, like +go get+ does. When you clone a remote repository by +ghq get+, ghq makes a directory under a specific root directory (by default +~/.ghq+) using the remote repository URL's host and path.

    $ ghq get https://github.com/motemen/ghq
    # Runs `git clone https://github.com/motemen/ghq ~/.ghq/github.com/motemen/ghq`

You can also list local repositories (+ghq list+), jump into local repositories (+ghq look+), and bulk cloning repositories from several web services (+ghq import+).

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
'ghq' get [-u] [-p] (<repository URL> | <user>/<project> | <project>)
'ghq' list [-p] [-e] [<query>]
'ghq' look (<project> | <path/to/project>)
'ghq' import starred [-u] [-p] <user>
'ghq' import pocket [-u]

== COMMANDS

get::
    Clone a remote repository under ghq root directory (see
    <<directory-structures,DIRECTORY STRUCTURES>> below). If the repository is
    already cloned to local, nothing will happen unless '-u' ('--update')
    flag is supplied, in which case the local repository is updated ('git pull --ff-only' eg.).
    When you use '-p' option, the repository is cloned via SSH protocol. +
    If there are multiple +ghq.root+ s, existing local clones are searched
    first. Then a new repository clone is created under the primary root if
    none is found. +
    With '-shallow' option, a "shallow clone" will be performed (for Git
    repositories only, 'git clone --depth 1 ...' eg.). Be careful that a
    shallow-cloned repository cannot be pushed to remote. +
    Currently Git and Mercurial repositories are supported.

list::
    List locally cloned repositories. If a query argument is given, only
    repositories whose names contain that query text are listed. '-e'
    ('--exact') forces the match to be an exact one (i.e. the query equals to
    _project_ or _user_/_project_) If '-p' ('--full-path') is given, the full paths
    to the repository root are printed instead of relative ones.

look::
    Look into a locally cloned repository with the shell.

import starred::
    Retrieves GitHub repositories that are starred by the user specified and
    performs 'get' for each of them.
    You can set GitHub access token to enviroment variable 'GHQ_GITHUB_TOKEN' or
    'ghq.github.taken' in 'git-config' variables. (The former takes precedence over
    the latter.)

import pocket::
    Retrieves http://getpocket.com/[Pocket] entries of github.com and
    performs 'get' for each of them. +
    To use this, needs to be compiled with Pocket consumer key. See <<installing,INSTALLING>>.

== CONFIGURATION

Configuration uses 'git-config' variables.

ghq.root::
    The path to directory under which cloned repositories are placed. See
    <<directory-structures,DIRECTORY STRUCTURES>> below. Defaults to +~/.ghq+. +
    This variable can have multiple values. If so, the first one becomes
    primary one i.e. new repository clones are always created under it. You may
    want to specify "$GOPATH/src" as a secondary root (environment variables
    should be expanded.)

ghq.<url>.vcs::
    ghq tries to detect the remote repository's VCS backend for non-"github.com"
    repositories.  With this option you can explicitly specify the VCS for the
    remote repository. The URL is matched against '<url>' using 'git config --get-urlmatch'. +
    Accepted values are "git", "github" (an alias for "git"), "mercurial", "hg"
    (an alias for "mercurial"). +
    To get this configuration variable effective, you will need Git 1.8.5 or higher. +
    For example in .gitconfig: +

....
[ghq "https://git.example.com/repos/"]
vcs = git
....


ghq.ghe.host::
    The hostname of your GitHub Enterprise installation. A repository that has a
    hostname set with this key will be regarded as same one as one on GitHub.
    This variable can have multiple values. If so, `ghq` tries matching with
    each hostnames. +
    This option is DEPRECATED, so use "ghq.<url>.vcs" configuration instead.

ghq.github.token::
    GitHub's access token used in `ghq import starred` command.

ghq.alias::
    The short name for sub-command. 

== [[directory-structures]]DIRECTORY STRUCTURES

Local repositories are placed under 'ghq.root' with named github.com/_user_/_repo_.

....

|-- code.google.com/
|   `-- p/
|       `-- vim/
`-- github.com/
    |-- codegangsta/
    |   `-- cli/

    |   `-- go-github/
    `-- motemen/
        `-- ghq/
....
